Every developer must have gone through some or **many** problems, so in order the avoid these problems as a developer you need to understand the fundamental laws of software and develop a mindset that will help you make better decisions.
There are some key points that any developer must learn:
1. **Conceiving The Purpose of Software**
 # The purpose of the software is to help other people and make it easier on them to use.
2. **The Goals of Software Design**
 # The goals of the design is to make the software easy and useful as possible.
3. **Solving Problems**
 # To solve problems you need to understand the problem then you need to think befor do anything and the last thing try solving it on phases not at once.
4. **Productivity**
  # You measure your productivity by delevering the same purpose with less codes.
5. **(Under)Estimation**
 # Dividing things into smaller parts makes it easier to estimate.
6. **Self-Development**
 # Develop your self by learning other programing languages and tools it will make you see from different angles.
**_At the end the more complex does not mean more intelgence but the more simple does._**
